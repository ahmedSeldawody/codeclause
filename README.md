# Image Recognition System using OpenCV

## Introduction:
This repository contains a simple image recognition system implemented using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library.
The system utilizes pre-trained classifiers like Haar Cascades for face detection.

## Project Structure:
main.py: Contains the main code for the image recognition system.
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: Pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
sample_images/: Directory containing sample images for testing the system.

## Instructions:
Import the required libraries.
Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
Load the image to be processed.
Convert the image to grayscale for face detection.
Perform face detection using the classifier.
Draw rectangles around the detected faces.
Display the original image and the image with detected faces.

## Dependencies:
Python 3.x
OpenCV 4.x
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
